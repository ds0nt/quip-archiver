<h2 id='LaeACAyivIu'>Why?</h2>

<p id='LaeACAern2s' class='line'>There is a clear opportunity to improve the world by creating products that empower and enrich their users, disrupting systems that create economic and social inequality.  We think that rapid, iterative improvements in production techniques, collaborative technologies, and intellectual property management are not only possible but within reach and that we have a duty to reach for it.  We desire a future that provides diffuse global wealth to all people, and we're building the tools necessary to take the next step towards that future.  </p>

<p id='LaeACAprdad' class='line'>We're quickly amassing a highly skilled network of people to help us accomplish our organizational goals.  As a multidisciplinary organization, we feel that it is necessary for our experts to cross-specalize with one another because this hybridization of product is what produces the best products for our customers.  To put it another way: <i>most of the best selling products of the next five years haven't even been conceptualized yet, and we want to be ready for anything.  </i> With our purpose driving us, we've chosen to make teaching and learning an element of our development cycle.  Classes will be available to the community in order to help train the next generation of our network of specialists.  </p>

<p id='LaeACAnDPGb' class='line'><b>Manufacturing</b></p>

<p id='LaeACA9CgdY' class='line'>We're going to bring BGA-based SMT manufacturing processes to Vietnam, and ensure that the knowledge driving that ability diffuses throughout the tech community.  We've also taken the step of fusing our manufacturing and knowledge teams into one in order to implement continuous improvement cycles that link software to hardware effectively.  To be clear on a point:  No one at MetaDev thinks Vietnam will win anything due to low wages compared to China.  We think that MetaDev has an advantage in Vietnam due to innovative thinking, free Internet communication, and open-mindedness.  Every position at MetaDev is a high-skill position, and that's the way it should be.  </p>

<p id='LaeACAFRtf6' class='line'><b>Global Sales</b></p>

<p id='LaeACA8YuGy' class='line'>We've long felt that a lack of access to opportunity is the cause of many of today's societal ills, and we're committed to doing something to provide that access: our global technology sales platform.  We've partnered with Reaction Commerce to provide a top-notch open source reactive e-commerce platform that's as easy to sell from as it is to buy from.  </p>
