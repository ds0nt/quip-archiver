<p id='JEEACAIjfTU' class='line'>By driving these connections and mixing things not mixed before we are increasing the network density of MetaDev's contacts (thus bringing us resilience), the local tech ecosystem, and every other impacted system/network someway entangled within MetaDev :)</p>

<p id='JEEACA8dhZp' class='line'>Within MetaDev, the model we are following the model of “ Incubation will occur as a natural outcome of network behavior and increasing of network density. Business incubator as a transformation mechanism that provides and actively facilitates links between industry, government, and university.</p>

<p id='JEEACAVFNEf' class='line'>Maintaining a presence on the bleeding edge of the market and readily access to new innovations is the key selling point for bringing in an 'industry giant', and in the case of DAWN + Intel this is especially apt (because it is certainly their goal, particularly <a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=36503">Intel's New Business Initiatives department</a>) </p>

<p id='JEEACAiI0CU' class='line'>According to George Por (2001), a successful work ecology is a "complete, organic, Ecosystem. It integrates many disciplines together to produce a dynamic, holistic view of the workplace and its relationship to its environment. It addresses all elements that make up today's high velocity, rapidly changing workplace, especially the way they interact in the form of work to produce the outcomes needed by the enterprise and its stakeholders" (Ward A., 1999). It is a rich "stew" of interdependent elements, continuously interacting and adapting to produce outcomes that ensure the vitality and sustainability of the enterprise (Por, 1999). </p>

<p id='JEEACAPMT3F' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='JEEACAY2Zpe' class='line'>Entrepreneurship is part of a virtuous circle where entrepreneruial activity leads to the circumstances and conditions that promote further activity, and on the flip side, zero activity can lead to a vicious circle (which informs the understanding of urban decline).</p>

<p id='JEEACApDYAq' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='JEEACAJGeaM' class='line'>The <a href="http://people.umass.edu/curtis/academics/researchtoolbox/pdfs/Paul_Krugman_and_the_NEG.pdf">New Economic Geopgraphy (NEG) research model</a> provides valuable insight that promotes the MetaDev concept. Paul Krugman, the founder of the model, performed a case study on Etna Valley, a microelctronics R&amp;D&amp;M[anufatcuring] hub in Sicilian Italy town of Catania that has proven to have all the pre-requisites for a successful and functioning ecosystem. In the study krugman noted that the “formalization of ecosystem supportive policies didn't rove particularly helpful” and that the replacement of complete vertical integration of production processes with a decentralization og small but significant functions in favor of local external actors. And THUS when these independent but supportive/collaborative actors identified a need in the ecosystem they developed it themselves as a collaborating entrepreneurial venture, thus fuelling the expansion of the ecosystem in an organic fashion, thereby requiring less management from the central organizing institution (IMPERATIVE for the MD model). The vvalue that these actors create must not only be utilized by the central isntitution, but must also be distributed to everyone else in the ecosystem. When we (MD) expand we will need to develop these external actors ourselves, but not in the FPT fashion (meaning: not follow their model of geographically decentralized universities, manufacturing, service providers, and other key components in their vast network) ((future MD city? :] ))</p>

<p id='JEEACAGzWCZ' class='line'>While the Etna Valley case-study can provide valuable insight, aspects of it are potentially outdated for use in the MD concept.... as it is an ecosystem that has it's genesis within the industrial revolution era of conditions, and supported by resources mostly unnecessary for our development (such as harbors, rivers, access to physical material, etc.), whereas we are more strongly supported by things not rendered nearly obsolete in this currently globalized world (information, innovation, global connectivity, etc.).</p>

<p id='JEEACAvoLUA' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='JEEACA2Bfsy' class='line'>We need to model the ideal urban economic/innovation promoting environment within our campuses and very thoroughly and scientifically record the process so that a standard approach (NOT a standard structure, because that would mean certain doom) can be used when adapting ourselves to each of the countries we develop within. But the benefits repaed from such a efficient modeling mustn't be limtied to the internal MD ecosystem (because we want to change the world), and thus must act as catalytic drivers for positive external human environments globally. We want to be a driving force for upturning urban innovtion environments currently in stagnation or decline. :D</p>

<p id='JEEACAMiHzv' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='JEEACAM2W63' class='line'>And on the connectivity densification aspect of MetaDev we need to capitalize on and further facilitate the global interconnectivity infrastructure (Klouds will be a central tenant in making this happen). While the geographical densification on a local level must occur, the densification of technological connectivity will connect each of these </p>

<p id='JEEACAc2bVr' class='line'>MetaDev = localized dense network/ecosystem. Local then Global --- Klouds = globalized interconnectivity that is localized. Global then Local. Each of these two forces working synchronously and supporting eachothers' development.</p>

<p id='JEEACAVSv22' class='line'>MetaDev, in order to be efficient needs many nodes in it's network, I won't list all of them here right now, but there are three critical componenets that CANNOT be missed out on.

<p id='JEEACAqqY8D' class='line'>Since the location of skilled workers and technical expertise seems to be so important, it is natural to focus on the mobility of technical workers and innovative activity. Kerr (this issue) and Dahl and Sorenson (this issue) each shed light here. Kerr examines the speed with which innovative activity migrates across cities in the United States. He demonstrates that development of breakthrough technologies tends to be followed by subsequent intensive research and development that refines the initial innovation. <annotation id="JEEACAPLVTR">This process attracts additional scientists and engineers to the location where the breakthrough occurs</annotation>, and contributes to movement of innovative activity across cities. The speed with which such adjustments occur depends in part on the mobility of technical workers. <annotation id="JEEACArdz89">Kerr demonstrates this by focusing on immigrant scientists and engineers, a group thought to be particularly mobile and footloose. Evidence confirms that industries reliant on immigrant technical workers exhibit faster migration of innovative activity towards locations where breakthroughs occur.</annotation></p>

<p id='JEEACAiX78K' class='line'><annotation id="JEEACAHkTk7"></annotation>Andersson extends Kirzner’s theory by explicitly introducing the role of space in entrepreneurial alertness and the coordination of markets (2005, p.21). Andersson notesthat profit opportunities are not equally available in all locations and that this factunderscores the importance of the spatial location of entrepreneurs (2005). The idea of the spatiotemporal is important here because individual skills, cognitive capacities andspecific external stimuli such as people, facts, prices, etc depend on location. (Andersson,2005). <annotation id="JEEACA9An3E"><b>If a group of actors are ‘clustered’ in a specific location, possessing a degree of specialized knowledge and are in a position to transmit knowledge as a result of socialinteraction, there will be those who will have their knowledge enhanced as a result of receiving the benefit of this interaction/transmission</b></annotation>. Andersson points out that ‘if anindividual is therefore located in a spatial agglomeration of economic activities, heshould be able to notice more profit opportunities (2005, p.24). Consequently the logicalassumption of this follows with Andersson’s statement that “ individuals discover profitopportunities in the course of interacting with people rather than in the course of solitarycontemplation and observation of disembodied information” (2005, p.24).</p>
