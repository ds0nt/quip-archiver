<p id='BRfACA9Oo6g' class='line'>Maintaining a presence on the bleeding edge of the market and readily access to new innovations is the key selling point for bringing in an 'industry giant', and in the case of DAWN + Intel this is especially apt (because it is certainly their goal, particularly Intel's New Business Initiatives department) </p>
