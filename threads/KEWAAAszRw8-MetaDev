<p id='KEWACAtrDjV' class='line'>Enhancing value networks and giving open source communities and projects their due role in society.  We believe that computer projects go better when they use the development strategy called open source.  Open technology starts with the hardware layer of our stack, instead of only in software.  This allows metadev to become an environment in which T-shaped professionsals grow and proper to acheive their goals, as well as the goals of an increasingly complicated technology industry.  </p>
