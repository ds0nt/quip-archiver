<h3 id='XPJACAQwZ3W'>Visa update</h3>

<p id='XPJACA7SP9J' class='line'>We are having Gouwa and a few other suppliers provide us with letters of support for the visas.   The hotel told us today "something something need support letters," so we are getting those.  We do not yet know if this will effect the visa timeline.  "That's China."</p>

<h3 id='XPJACAGrPts'>Contacts in Hanoi</h3>

<p id='XPJACAE4Tbt' class='line'>A few months ago I met someone from Future electronics (global, multi-billion USD component supply chain company) who works in Hanoi.  HaiBac introduced me to Đung, owner of MinhHa electronics.   Đung's facility and creativity were quite impressive.  There is a possibility that we may be able to assemble here, which I am going to explore.  HaiBac is doing a search for me which he is well positioned to do— highly efficient processors sporting penta band 3g and WiFi.  HaiBac also provides a channel to mediatek, I will let you all know if that gets anywhere: I do not know if it will, but I am here, and figure that it can't hurt.</p>
