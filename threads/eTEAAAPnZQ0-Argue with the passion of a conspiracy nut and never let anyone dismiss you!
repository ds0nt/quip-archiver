<p id='eTEACA5KDnC' class='line'>But I kinda think it's high time that we speak of the future.  There's this Japanese word kaizen, meaning “Good Change,” or “continuous improvement” (language really is tricky).   Kaizen is what we want, and as a species, what we deserve.  We've fought, cried, tortured, bled, died, fucked, bred, etc... for kaizen.  And each time, hierarchical power structures crept back into play.  There's a sliver of an opportunity to put them down for good, or at the very least drastically reduce the role that they are able to play in human societies.   It will not be easy, and it will not be cheap.  That said, it's going to be a hell of a lot of fun people.  You deserve this.  Each and every one of you has struggled just to be here just to read these words, just to breathe.  I don't propose to end the struggle, but I sure as hell plan to change the goal of the struggle, and fast!</p>
