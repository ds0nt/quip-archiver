<p id='IdTACAjpLjJ' class='line'>Hello Kyle,</p>

<p id='IdTACAy5Fv7' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='IdTACA2D6Y2' class='line'>What a great surprise! I wasn't planning on hearing from you so soon, as I was first waiting for an ok from Joni!</p>

<p id='IdTACAZOE7f' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='IdTACAgrTLL' class='line'>Unfortunately I just arrived to Hue. If I had known about your willingness to meet up I would have definitely stayed longer! What a pity! Are you by any chance planning on coming here or to Ho Chi Minh or Singapore in the next days? I would love to have a face to face meeting, although I am also used to have virtual meetings.</p>

<p id='IdTACA8Avxp' class='line'>About the company and its projects: since the very beginning I saw a big opportunity in your company and the area and continent where you want to develop it. But what I liked the most was the energy that Joni transmitted when talking about you all and the way you work. For me it is really important the peer group with who I am getting involved and I thought I could definitely see myself in such an environment. From all the projects you described, the one I am more interested in is the Oasis Project! Although I would love to have more information in general about all of them. About the position: I must say accounting is not something I have in mind when thinking about my professional career. </p>

<p id='IdTACAhOer1' class='line'>I honestly think I am able to do a more challenging job and I could easily fit in many areas of the company. I am not sure if right now you are looking for people in other areas as well and I understand you don't know me enough (that was why I wanted the face to face meeting). I am totally open to discuss the possibility of fitting the different areas of the company and if you think the accounting could be a start and it will be challenging somehow I could definitely give it a try!</p>

<p id='IdTACA7isem' class='line'>One important thing for me would be where should I be stablished. I was planning to move to Singapore, although I am willing (and very happy) to travel and I am also open for other options in Asia (and actually all around the world). I have experience on teleworking so that could also be an option (not my favourite though). Could you tell me more about the location of the business? </p>

<p id='IdTACAe0k2i'>I would like to thank you for getting in contact so fast as well as for the inspiring tone of your message! </p>

<p id='IdTACAQYHlL'>@ Hope you find something interesting in what I am saying and, of course, I am looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

<p id='IdTACAmpce2'>Kind regards,</p>

<h2 id='IdTACAR4Y8Z'>Her second response</h2>

<p id='IdTACA06lkn' class='line'>Hello!!! I would definitely like to have that skype meeting! I am going back to Spain tonight (transit in Singapore, hk and Pekin). Shall we make an appointment in a few days once I am back and recovered from this crazy month? Oh and one more thing, when you say "based here" you mean Hanoi or Singapore? Thanks a lot and talk soon! Maria</p>
