<h2 id='HAcACAMFaur'>What?</h2>

<p id='HAcACAvO42Y' class='line'>A comprehensive coming together of thinkers and doers from innovation ecosystems into one common space</p>

<h2 id='HAcACAYEDOm'>Why?</h2>

<p id='HAcACAMy1iV' class='line'>In Vietnam (and many other regions of the world) ideas often miss their chance to become a reality due to an undeveloped ecosystem and an inability to establish a well rounded network. This highly integrated open network model will maximize innovative potential and lead to positive transformation both locally and globally.</p>

<h2 id='HAcACAUphM9'>Who?</h2>

<p id='HAcACADsiSf' class='line'>An artfully crafted mix of everyone it takes to make a new technology a reality. Firstly, this means entrepreneurs, developers, manufacturers, industry giants, and investors. But we haven't forgotten about the other guys... Though often going less noticed, play crucial roles in producing technologies and building ecosystems. These are university educators and researchers, graphic designers, legal advisors, marketing strategists, communications hubs, and so forth. No successful technology has ever been launched without direct or indirect contact with each of these key players. </p>

<h2 id='HAcACAsHHC9'>Where?</h2>

<p id='HAcACAxQ5Va' class='line'>A collaborative environment for<annotation id="HAcACA2xEhg"> each member</annotation> in the <annotation id="HAcACAGAnZZ">regional</annotation> ecosystem to sync together and rapidly produce new technologies. Incubation of the ecosystem, knowledge sharing and development of new technologies will be a natural outcome of such a such network, but the buck doesn't stop there. There will be a team of strategists, network specialists, and technologists identifying and actively facilitating links of mutual value among network members. </p>

<h2 id='HAcACA29741'>Why would they join?</h2>

<p id='HAcACABeSqh' class='line'>Look, it's a more robust version of the common co-working space. People like them. The reason people like co-working spaces is because it brings them closer to other people that can help them achieve their goals. They want to expand their capacity by being part of a larger network. </p>

<p id='HAcACAuKfzb' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='HAcACAtbX4v' class='line'>We have the capacity to truly bring all key players in the ecosystem into the same physical domain. The network they would have access to would be expansive and comprehensive... And the best part is, we can give them this space <i>for free</i>.  If someone gave you this opportunity, what would make you say no?</p>

<p id='HAcACAh6LwJ' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='HAcACA4Thwz' class='line'>While the above mostly applies to entrepreneurs and freelancers, there also many strong incentives for everyone else. </p>

<p id='HAcACA2Z1Mb' class='line'>Industry giants would gain easy access to all innovations from the ecosystem. They can choose to invest, purchase, or co-produce new technologies/companies. </p>

<p id='HAcACAILNzx' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='HAcACA5g2OW' class='line'>It is becoming an increasingly known fact that established enterprises need to maintain a presence on the bleeding edge of innovation in order to stay relevant. This goes for every industry. Those who chose to take advantage of disruptive technologies rather than abstain from them will henceforth be called “Intelligent Industrialists”.</p>

<p id='HAcACAJameT' class='line'>​</p>

<h2 id='HAcACA9QP7R'>If it's a free space, how do you make money?</h2>

<p id='HAcACAMMcP3' class='line'>It's rather simple. For providing the physical space, incubation of the ecosystem, and providing various strategic services/platforms, we take a small but sustainable portion of money-generating activities that occur within the space.</p>

<p id='HAcACAF9HxY' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='HAcACA0w8rf' class='line'><b>Example #1</b>: a start-up founder has a strong technical team, but needs graphic design support. They meet with the on-site graphic designer (also a third party), and the graphic designer charges them a fee for his/her services. We would accrue 5-10% of those fees.</p>

<p id='HAcACAyYVqw' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='HAcACAF9AY3' class='line'><b>Example #2</b>: an industry giant (let's say, Intel), likes a new technology that has been developed within the ecosystem. They choose to either: <b>(i)</b> purchase the company and we receive a portion of that offer; <b>(ii)</b> co-produce it and we receive a portion of equity; or <b>(iii)</b> invest in it and we receive a small portion of that investment. </p>

<p id='HAcACAgCrSw' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='HAcACAxB5oy' class='line'><b>Example #3</b>: Because cross-industry fertilization leads to the most innovative technologies, we would hold “Innovation Market” days where leaders of various industries (Intelligent Industrialists!) come to the space and present their challenges to key players in the ecosystem. Technical solutions are proposed and follow-on deals are made. When a deal is made, not only will society benefit from more efficient industries, but we will also benefit by receiving a portion of the money.</p>
