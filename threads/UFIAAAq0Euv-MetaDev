<p id='UFIACAeXFHE' class='line'>We are creating a mechanism to capitalize on innovative momentum within Vietnam (and using it as a model to be adapted globally), in which the core agents driving the ecosystem in Vietnam compound each of their endeavors to exponentially increase their impact. They will by catalysts that focus their efforts on one shared vision: creating a center for innovation in Vietnam. The go-to precinct for the development of new, transformative technologies.</p>

<p id='UFIACAMTbLt' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='UFIACA4send' class='line'>Currently, the actors driving the momentum in Vietnam's innovation ecosystem share the same vision, but are fragmented in their activities. This presents us a tremendous opportunity to centralize these activites under a model/organization/movement that encompasses each of their current activies, compunding each of them, and filling in all of the necessary gaps from there. It will be the 'go to' entity for all of Vietnam's innovation. A model that simultaneously spurs creativity (through fairs and lectures); generates innovation (by providing a link between those who have a need and those who have a solution); brings those innovations to fruition (through the densified ecosystem model that we have generated  that provides a framework for rapid prototyping and market entry); and </p>

<p id='UFIACAKaUmI' class='line'>“<i>With our powers combined</i>,” we will achieve exponential effect, but we won't stop there. We will also have the branding leverage to mobilize <a href="https://doc.co/Yh9Vbt">other actors</a> (each of the nodes we believe essential to our model) such as Intel, a legal firm, other ecosystem pioneers, etc.. And once we get %60 of the desired nodes into the netowrk, the work will be done, and they will be coming to us rather than us approaching them.</p>

<h2 id='UFIACA5RBwh'>Questions for today:</h2>

<p id='UFIACApTJIB' class='line'>​</p>

<p id='UFIACA9jC3A' class='line'><b>How do we BRAND this movement? and, how will we brand the entity that develops?</b></p>

<p id='UFIACAyOGvD' class='line'>First we must focus on branding this movement,a nd the branding of the entitty that develops will follow.</p>

<p id='UFIACAt4scQ' class='line'>I would say MetaDeV, BUT me, nor my team, are emotionally attached to this name. Nor do I think every one of the other actors would be willing to adapt themselves to this. We must make sure everyone knows we are NOT seeking to make everyone mold themselves to someone else. What we ARE doing is co-producing a new model forward, with the initial framework being what Kyle/MD team has proposed. </p>
